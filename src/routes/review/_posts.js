		"college_specifics": "<h3><strong>NUMBER OF COLLEGE BUILDINGS </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four buildings, one new building on college campus, one old building, along with two buildings in the hospital block.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>ARE THE COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL LOCATED AT DIFFERENT PLACES ?<br /></strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Hospital: </strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">K R market, about 4.2km away from the college campus.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>College:<br /></strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banashankari 2nd stage.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>HOW OLD IS THE COLLEGE</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Established in 1980</span></p>\n<h3><strong>HOW ARE THE SENIORS TO THE JUNIORS in campus?</strong></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day scholars are usually not that available, so unless you try to make friends people dont approach you, since it is medical school you need to remember that about 70% of the students are introverts, you can expect to meet your immediate seniors and have a decent relationship with them but not the other years because the intersection is quiet less.</span></h3>\n<h3><strong>WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT YOUR COLLEGE?<br /></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The carefree nature that you will find is something to be proud about, you will not be forced into the unhealthy competition like those students in the government colleges, the students in general are more laid back and no one really troubles you in any way, especially in the first year the teachers hold your hand and help you transition easily into the grinding nature of medical school.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>What do you hate about your college?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day it is still a private college so the number of patients you see is very less, the two departments Ortho and dermatology are flooded by patients but you can see a lot of free beds in other departments. The experience you get is comparatively less and if you are competitive by nature the environment might not nurture your ambitions.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will be mostly expected to do your work and other extracurricular activities are very limited.</span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Main Language spoken in college</strong> : English&gt;Kannada&gt;Hindi&gt;Malayalam&gt;Tamil</span></h3>\n<h3><strong>How do students cope with cultural differences if any?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it is in Bangalore you will be exposed to a diverse culture and this isnt new, the local crowd is receptive to other cultures.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You wont be discriminated based on that, but you can expect to find groups or similar set of people like a group containing mainly kannada speaking group, malayali group and hindi speaking group, since you cant chose your roll number you will make friends from your batch and wont face a lot of friction anywhere, and you still have options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the first thing to survive here is to form groups, then you will be motivated to study for longer hours after the classes are done and if you are the kind of person who reads better alone then there is a dedicated reading room that is open most of the time and a small canteen. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Reading Room</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Number: 2&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>1 in college&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is open 24hrs and is not very full.</span></p>\n<p><strong>1 in the hospital </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is open only till 9pm and closes with the library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming to the reading room, you need to maintain absolute silence and is usually filled with people reading for their NEET exams so that group is always there, and during the peak exam time you will find a lot of people and it can get crowded at time, but usually it is free. You can bring your own books here too, unlike the library where it is not allowed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College is a better place to read compared to the hospital, as there are certain restrictions placed at the hospital. Mobile data usually doesn't work properly in the hospital.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find that doing this will help you save a lot of time, and then be efficient as well.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a sort of amphitheatre, where students go to play and at times you can use it to discuss and revise the portions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advantage in college is that you will be getting easy access for your first two years and later on it will be harder to adjust once you reach final year because you will not have any business on college campus.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Library</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two libraries, and you will be able to access computers in both of them but UGs are mostly allowed to take the book home only in the college one, if you are looking for a place to sit with lesser distraction and the attenders making less noise then the hospital library is better, that is the end of it and when you see any other parameter you will find that the one at the college is a lot better, there are a lot more books, and the best part here is you can even take a prepladder tab and use it to watch videos and not worry about data.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will be asked to make a library card for a small fee, around 100rs and it's your choice here. If you feel like you don't need it then you can always use your friend, even though this one is bigger you might be distracted by the noise that is caused by people trying to fill water bottle as this is the only place, and the attenders talking to each other.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Computer room review</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: .</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total - 2</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College library 20 computers,&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hospital library 25 computers, these are ways better and it is more comfortable.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
		"hospital_specifics": "### Number of floors\nThere are two blocks, and each block has six floors with one academic floors.\n### Super Speciality\nYes\n### Places to read with least disturbance\nYou can expect to find place to read only near the academic floor which is on the 6th floor.\nThere is also the OBG demo room which is open 24hrs where you are expected to do night duties and can use that opportunity to read\n### Cantene\nTimings of cantene along with the type and quality of food. : This closes by 7pm and is located in the college campus, you cant expect to get very good food here and the choice is very limited, but the packaged food is available which is manageable.\nThe hospital has a restaurant: This closes by 10pm and is of higher quality with majority south indian menu.\nOther places: since the plan is to overstay, the availability of outside campus food stations",

However you might find yourself fighting with people as there is only one per floor and it&rsquo;s hard to see times when they are free to use.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Security guard</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is always a guard sitting outside. So it&rsquo;s pretty safe as they don&rsquo;t allow people from outside to come in.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Room cleaning</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free. Somebody comes to clean your room every single morning So it&rsquo;s pretty good.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Study room</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a hostel room where a lot of students can study.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes , there are 2 main study rooms. Ones bigger than the other. Most spots in the study rooms are already reserved by most of the seniors, however you will find some empty spots most of the times. Nobody is allowed to make any noises or talk when everybody is studying , so that helps. These are totally packed before and during exams and make for a really good environment as you don&rsquo;t feel lonely during intense studying sessions. It&rsquo;s kind of a study partner place where you can get motivated by your seniors and friends. I have a lot of memories studying with my friends here. I absolutely love this place</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Parking&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bike stand in boys hostel - most students in our college own bikes or activas. This is just in the hostel and is mixed in with the garden. Hostelites spend a lot of time sitting on or standing near bikes, chatting here while enjoying the garden .</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Water</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water is available most of the time . If there is no water in second and third floors , there will be water in first floor. So the students would have to use the washrooms where water is available. However there have been days when no water was there in the hostel and we had to go to a nearby building to borrow water for bathing in the morning.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Power</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Power facility is adequate. Though there is a generator , it is only switched on if the power loss is for long hours. Also the generator is shared between boys and girls hostel .</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Mess Review</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mess provides really good food most of the days, however you&rsquo;ll get bored of it pretty fast.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee and tea are available during breakfast and at 5pm everyday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday - mess is closed for dinner so be prepared to order from outside&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feast - one meal per month . This i the best food and they even give you 2 desserts so yay !</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me and most of my friends got bored of it by second year when we found ourselves either&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skipping a few meals per week or ordering from outside.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also has a big tv so be prepared to watch a lot of cricket and football matches with people screaming at the top of their voices while eating.</span></p>",

First year and second year theory classes happen in the Banashankari campus while third , final year and internship is at the hospital in VVpuram.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Distance of hostels from college</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Located very near to the preclinical buildings but 5 kms away from the main building.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Number of floors</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Lift </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></p>\n<h3><strong>No. of people per room in general</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 3</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Single room available</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> No</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Attached Bathroom</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, Shared bathrooms on each floor. Though they are cleaned regularly , hygiene is a concern since they are used by everyone and there would be a rush in the morning since everyone will be using the washrooms.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>AC </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. But can be put up if you want at your expenditure</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Microwaves&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Two working </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ovens are there. One in the mess and one in fourth floor.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Canteen</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> NO</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Washing Machines</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are only four working washing machines which are available in the ground floor. It is free for hostelites to use but since there are only four machines for the whole hostel and it will only work on specific times of the day , it is difficult to get a spot for putting your clothes unless you live on the ground floor. But one can also get their clothes washed by the Ammas residing in the hostel at a small monthly fee.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is always a security guard sitting outside, entry would be made if someone needs to go home or out of station. Most times , the hostel supervisor is also seen to sit in the entrance watching students come and go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curfew is at 9.30 which means the gates close at 9.30 and students should be inside before that time. If they are late, entries would be made in the late comers book , and after a few warnings they would be asked to call the hostel warden or parents are called by the warden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are CCTV cameras placed at all entrances and varandas on all floors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff is very friendly and cooperative. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Room Cleaning&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rooms are three sharing and are cleaned regularly. Repair works are done once a week and complaints can be registered in the hostel office on ground floor regarding electrical and mechanical repairs.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Study Rooms</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two study halls, one in ground floor and one in fourth floor. The one in ground floor is in the basement and hence water leaks from the washrooms above. Less students use this study hall.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study hall in fourth floor is well furnished with good tables and chairs. These are almost always filled with students .</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Water</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water is available most of the time . If there is no water in the second and third floors , there will be water in first and fourth floors. So the students would have to use the washrooms where water is available.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Power</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Power facility is adequate. Though there is a generator , it is only switched on if the power loss is for long hours. Also the generator is shared between boys and girls hostels.<br /></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Mess</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provides food four times a day including breakfast , lunch, evening snacks and dinner. A menu is put out every week in the mess noticeboard. There is also a mess perfect who is a student representative who will take concerns and complaints of students and act accordingly. There is non veg on Wednesdays and Sundays. Sunday night the mess would be closed for cleaning.
